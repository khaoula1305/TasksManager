Dear,
I am a software engineer, with my extensive experience as a software engineer, particularly in working with Blazor and ASP.NET Core Web API, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your project.
I have been involved in several projects that required the creation and management of robust web applications.
I have a deep understanding of implementing authorization and role-based access controls, which aligns perfectly with your need for multiple user roles and permissions in the task manager.
Furthermore, I have attached a video demonstrating a portion of a task manager app I recently worked on as a side projects. 
Best regards,
